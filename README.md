**Essential Knowledge**

To successfully complete this project, make sure to review the following Python concepts:

- **Lists and List Comprehensions**:
    - Create, access, modify, and iterate over lists.
    - Use list comprehensions for concise and readable code, particularly for generating rows of Pascal’s Triangle.

- **Functions**:
    - Define and call functions.
    - Handle parameters and return values, especially to return a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.

- **Loops**:
    - Utilize `for` and `while` loops for sequence iteration.
    - Use nested loops to generate each row and calculate values in Pascal’s Triangle.

- **Conditional Statements**:
    - Implement logic with `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, particularly for edge cases where values are always 1.

- **Recursion (Optional)**:
    - Understand recursion as an alternative method for generating Pascal’s Triangle.
    - Recognize base cases and recursive cases.

- **Arithmetic Operations**:
    - Perform addition to calculate each element as the sum of the two elements directly above it.

- **Indexing and Slicing**:
    - Access elements and slices of lists to correctly identify and sum elements for each row.

- **Memory Management**:
    - Be aware of list storage and copying, especially when creating new rows based on previous values.

- **Error and Exception Handling (Optional)**:
    - Use `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors, such as invalid input.

- **Efficiency and Optimization**:
    - Consider the time and space complexity of different approaches to generating Pascal’s Triangle.
    - Apply optimizations to improve performance.

By revisiting these concepts, you'll be prepared to implement Pascal’s Triangle in Python, leveraging both your mathematical knowledge and programming skills.

**Tasks**

**0. Pascal's Triangle (Mandatory)**
- **Objective**: Create a function `def pascal_triangle(n):` that returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascal’s Triangle with `n` rows:
    - Return an empty list if `n <= 0`.
    - Assume `n` will always be an integer.

**Example Implementation**:
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
0-main
"""
pascal_triangle = __import__('0-pascal_triangle').pascal_triangle

def print_triangle(triangle):
    """
    Print the triangle
    """
    for row in triangle:
        print("[{}]".format(",".join([str(x) for x in row])))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_triangle(pascal_triangle(5))
```

**Expected Output**:
```
[1]
[1,1]
[1,2,1]
[1,3,3,1]
[1,4,6,4,1]
```
